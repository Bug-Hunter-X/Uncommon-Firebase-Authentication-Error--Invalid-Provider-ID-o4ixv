The Firebase Authentication SDK might throw an unexpected error when attempting to sign in with a credential object that has an invalid provider ID.  This can occur if the provider ID is misspelled or doesn't match the available authentication providers configured in your Firebase project.  The error message might be generic and not directly point to the invalid provider ID, making debugging challenging.

Example (JavaScript):
```javascript
firebase.auth().signInWithCredential(credential).catch(error => {
  // Error handling that doesn't explicitly identify the invalid provider ID
  console.error("Sign-in failed:", error);
});
```
