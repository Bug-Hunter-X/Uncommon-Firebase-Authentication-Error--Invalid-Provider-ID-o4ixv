# Uncommon Firebase Authentication Error: Invalid Provider ID

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error scenario in Firebase Authentication involving the `signInWithCredential` method. The error occurs when an invalid provider ID is used within the credential object.  The error handling in the original code is not robust enough to identify the specific cause.

The `authBug.js` file illustrates the problematic code.  The `authSolution.js` provides a corrected and more robust version.

## Problem

The `signInWithCredential` method throws a generic error when presented with an invalid provider ID.  This makes identifying the root cause difficult. The solution improves error handling to provide more specific information about the failure, facilitating easier debugging.

## Solution

The solution implements a more sophisticated error-handling mechanism to check for specific error codes related to invalid provider IDs.  It then provides informative error messages, making debugging faster and more efficient.
